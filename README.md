## 2021 
This was the first year I discovered AoC, and thus doing every challenge the day they released, with some (hard) exceptions.
The code was a mess and I tried to clean it up before uploading but it was over a year ago, I might come back to it.
It might not even compile at this point ...

## 2022
Almost all challenges have been done as they released, except days 16, 17, 19 and 22.
Getting some decent prerformances on almost all days, running every challenge in roughly 25 seconds.
The biggest disappointment are for day 16 and the nasty performance ( over 15 seconds) and day 22 for the lack of generalization (hardcode some of my inputs).
